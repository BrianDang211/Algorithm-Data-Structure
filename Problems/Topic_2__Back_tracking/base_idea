1) Understand about recursive programming:
+ Call Stack
+ Call Memory Stack
2) Analystic input
3) Find rule: 
Common Thinking:
Elements => x[1]
            => From x[1]
                  => Find all elements for x[2]
                        => From x[2]
                              => Find all elements => x[3]
                              ....
                                    => From x[n]
                                          => find all elements => x[n+1]
                                                ....
                                                      => From x[n+i]
                                                            => find all elements => x[n+i-1]
                                                                  => From x[n+i-1]
                                                                        => find all elements x[n]  \\ result back-tracking from before step
==> Merge results to x[i-1] from x[i] (i=1...n)
4) In rule from step 3, write code to implement rule from step 3 (use recursive programming)
5) Design Test case matrix to test for step 4
6) Re-check step 4 and fix bug
