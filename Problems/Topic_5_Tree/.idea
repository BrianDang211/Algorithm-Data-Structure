1) Documentation for simulation Tree on command screen of the window.
- The first one, I will show the simulation as an below image:

For instance, we have a tree as follow:
1 -> [2,3,4]
2 -> [4,5]
3 -> [7,8,9]
5 -> [6]

So when we draw above tree, it seems like this:

      1
      |           |                 |
      2           3                 4
      |     |     |     |     |
      4     5     7     8     9
            |
            6
