We have some concept about graph.
1) What is the graph?
The graph is a data structure which include two elements:
- The first element, it calls vertice
- The second element, it calls edge
We have short-write a graph:
      G=(V,E)
+ V: Vertices
+ E: Edges

From here we have question, How many type of the graph?

We have two group:
The first group: 
*** Single graph:
- From vertice u to vertice v exist greatest one edge (undirect or direct)

*** Multi graph:
- It means between vertice u and vertice v exist least one edges.

*** Undirect graph:
- Edge connect vertice u and vertice v is undirect

*** Direct graph:
- Edge connect vertice u and vertice v is direct

Please disscuss about type of edge:
One edge:
1) undirect Edge
2) direct Edge
Inside each edge, it has weight of it


The second group: Multi graph

*** Vertice: 
For undirect graph:
- Vertice Adjacent: Between two vertices exist a edge to connect vertice u to vertice v.
      (u,v) is vertice adjacent if and only if exist a edge (direct or undirect edge) connect them.
      this edge calls e
And edge e is call incident with vertice u and vertice v.
- Degree of a vertice:
What is the degree of a vertice?
So the degree of a vertice is number of vertice adjacent with it.

For direct graph:
- Out degree: It means number of out edge 

- In degree: It means number of in edge

*** isomorphic:
G=(V,E)
G'=(V',E')

Exist 

*** Connected Graph: (relate to undirect graph)
Every (u,v) => always exist least one path from u to v

*** Strong Connected Graph: (relate to direct graph) 
Every (u,v) => always exist least one path from u to v, and v to u

*** Weekly connected graph: (relate to direct graph):
- if the undirect version of it is the connected graph

*** Complete Graph:
- Indirect graph
- Every vertice pair is adjacent

*** Bipartite Graph (Đồ thị 2 phía):
- Indirect Graph
- The vertice separated to two collections, we can call it X,Y

X=(x1,x2,x3,x4,...,xn)
Y=(y1,y2,y3,y4,...,yn)

only exist edge from x -> y or y -> x

*** Hyper Graph:
- Indrect graph

How to the simulation a graph?

- Matrix (two dimentions)

- Array (one dimention)
(u,v) -> (u1,v1) -> (u2, v2) -> ... -> (u[n], v[n])
(The length of array dependece by edges)

- Linked list
+ (u,v) -> (u1,v1) -> (u2,v2) -> ... -> (u[n], v[n])

*** Issue:
When we want to check all adjacency an vertice, we must interator all item in array or linked list and check if exist vertice.

v1, v2, v3, ..., vn
Heads -> memories start of each vertices

Array
1 -> [1,2,3]
2 -> [3,4,5]
3 -> [5,6,7]

Lisked list:
node_1 -> {node_2, node_3}
