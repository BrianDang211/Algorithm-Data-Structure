/**
 * What is the fleury algothirm?
 * 
 * So the fleury algothirm is an algothirm used to find a cycle euler
 * 
 * So what is a the cycle euler?
 * The cycle euler is a path can go over all vertice of a graph, and this path is contain all edge 
 * of graph.
 * 
 * Summary some feature to define a cycle euler:
 * 1) Must exist a single cycle which contains all edge of graph.
 * 2) Each edge only went over one time.
 * 
 * 
 * We have some concepts:
 * - A single cycle contains all edge of graph so it called "cycle euler"
 * - A single path which contains all edge of graph, so it called "euler path"
 * - A graph has "euler cycle", it called "euler graph"
 * - A graph has "euler path", it called "half euler graph"
 * 
 * *** From "cycle euler", we have some theorem:
 * - With a undirected graph has cycle euler when all vertice of it have degree equal two.
 * - With a undirected and connected graph has "euler path" but hasn't "euler cycle" when it only has two odd vertices
 * - A directed and weakly graph has "euler cycle" so every vertice have in degree equal out degree.  
 * 
 * How can I find a cycle euler?
 * 
 * To find a cycle euler, we have an algothirm, it called fleury algothirm.
 * 
 * How to implement it?
 *
