/**
 * To check a graph which has euler circuit, we can use some theorem of it.
 * 
 * Re-talk some theorem of a euler circuit
 * 
 * 1. A undirected and connected graph has euler circuit when and only when every vertice of it has two degrees
 * 2. A undirected and connected graph has euler path but hasn't euler circuit when and only when it has only 
 * two odd vertices.
 * 
 * The two concepts above relate to undirected and connected graph
 * 
 * 3. A weakly directed graph has "euler circuit" so every vertice have in degree equal out degree.
