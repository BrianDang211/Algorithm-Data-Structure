 * Let's re-talk this problem:
 * 
 * A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
 * The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
