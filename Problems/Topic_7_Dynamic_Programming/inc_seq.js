 * Input: An integer array (not sorted in increasing or decreasing)

 * inside input array we can not change the position of it (this means the order of each element still keep)
 * we can normal understand that the elements after an element when it pick and put into the result it still after this
 * element
 * 
 * 1) We must handle for dynamic programming logic (we must find it)
 * 2) We must setup for some base-case
 * 3) We will calculate for our problem
