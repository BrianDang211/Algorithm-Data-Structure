1) Understand about recursive programming:
+ Call Stack
+ Call Memory Stack
2) Analytic input
3) Find rule: 
Common Thinking:
Elements => x[1]
            => From x[1]
                  => Elements => x[2]
                        => From x[2]
                              => Elements => x[3]
                              ....
                                    => From x[n]
                                          => Elements => x[n]
                                                ....
                                                      => From x[n-k]
                                                            => Elements => x[n-k]
                                                                  => From x[1]
                                                                        => Elements x[1]  \\ result back-tracking from before step
4) In rule from step 3, write code to implement rule from step 3 (use recursive programming)
5) Design Test case matrix to test for step 4
6) Re-check step 4 and fix bug
