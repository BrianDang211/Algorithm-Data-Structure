- In C we can use a standard library for print output:
- It called stdio.h
- printf(args)
      args:
            - s1: output_formatter
                  + %[number_of_digit_wide]d
                  + %[number_of_digit_wide].[number_of_fraction_digit_after_decimal_point]f
                  + %o (for octal number)
                  + %x (for hexadecimal number)
                  + %c (for character)
                  + %s (for character string)
                  + %% (for itself)
